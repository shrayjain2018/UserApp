  User management describes the ability for administrators to manage user access to various IT resources like systems,
  devices, applications, storage systems, networks, SaaS services, and more. User management is a core part to any
  directory service and is a basic security essential for any organization. User management enables admins to control
  user access and on-board and off-board users to and from IT resources. Subsequently a directory service will then
  authenticate, authorize, and audit user access to IT resources based on what the IT admin had dictated.
